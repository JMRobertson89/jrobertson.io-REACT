# A New Chapter

**Published on October 22, 2024**

Hello, world! My name is Josh, and I’m excited to share my journey as I transition my career into the dynamic world of software engineering.

## Why Software Engineering?

After years of working in sales and client services, I found myself increasingly drawn to the technical side of things. It was a push from friends and family in the industry.

## Learning Journey

To kick off my journey, I enrolled in the UConn School of Engineering's Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp, where I honed my skills in technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and React.

I’ve faced challenges, such as understanding all the available technologies. But with persistence and the help of self-research, I've been able to overcome these hurdles. Though of course, the learning never stops.

## The Importance of Community

One of the most rewarding aspects of this journey has been connecting with fellow learners and experienced developers who have provided invaluable support and inspiration. I've learned so much from others’ experiences and hope to give back as I grow.

## What’s Next?

Looking ahead, I plan to continue building my portfolio with more complex projects. I’m excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and the skills I’ll acquire along the way.
In conclusion, I’m thrilled to embark on this new chapter. I invite you to join me on this journey—feel free to share your stories or tips on transitioning into tech!
