# My Coding Bootcamp Experience

**Published on January 17, 2025**

## A Journey of Resilience

The philosopher Zeno experienced a profound life shift after surviving a shipwreck that destroyed his livelihood as a wealthy merchant. Stranded in Athens, Zeno discovered philosophy and embraced it as a new way of life. His teachings emphasized resilience, self-discipline, and finding purpose through adversity—principles that resonate deeply with my own journey. Like Zeno, I turned a life-altering challenge into an opportunity to redefine my path and pursue a career that aligns with my passion for problem-solving and creation.

Life has a way of steering us down unexpected paths. For me, recovering from cancer wasn’t just a physical and emotional challenge—it was a catalyst to finding my own purpose through adversity. I decided to re-evaluate my career and take a bold step into the world of software engineering. This is my synopsis of that learning journey.

## Finding the Motivation for Change

Throughout my career in sales and account management, I often found myself intrigued by the products and services I sold. I’d wonder about the technology behind them and the people who brought those ideas to life. My interest wasn’t new. As a kid, I loved tinkering with both hardware and software, taking apart devices to see how they worked and dabbling in basic programming. Yet, as life got busier, that curiosity took a backseat to other responsibilities and distractions.

The idea of returning to school always felt out of reach, especially as my wife and I were trying to start a family. But during my recovery, I had time to reflect. Close friends and family members who worked in tech encouraged me to explore coding more seriously. At first, I hesitated. I knew bootcamps had been all the rage a few years ago, but I worried they might no longer hold the same credibility. Fortunately, several acquaintances in engineering hiring roles assured me that employers still value non-traditional paths, especially when combined with transferable skills and a proven commitment to learning.

## Taking the Leap

Confident that my degree in Business Administration and years of professional experience would provide a strong foundation, I decided to enroll in UConn School of Engineering’s Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp. The program focused on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), but we also explored other technologies such as SQL databases.

## Enjoying the Process

One of the most rewarding aspects of the bootcamp was discovering how much I genuinely enjoyed the different layers of web development. On the front end, I found a creative outlet in customizing web pages and applications using CSS. Libraries like Bootstrap and Tailwind allowed me to design sleek, user-friendly interfaces that brought ideas to life. There was something incredibly satisfying about seeing a project take shape visually and knowing I had control over every detail, from color schemes to layout responsiveness.

On the back end, my fascination with data management and architecture grew immensely. I loved working with both SQL and NoSQL databases, diving into the process of structuring, storing, and retrieving data efficiently. Crafting queries and optimizing data models felt like solving intricate puzzles, with each solution contributing to a seamless user experience. The dynamic nature of back-end development gave me a deeper appreciation for how technology powers the applications we use every day.
What truly stood out during this process was how these two domains complemented each other. The ability to bridge front-end creativity with back-end logic provided me with a well-rounded perspective on full-stack development. It wasn’t just about learning new skills; it was about building the confidence to bring a concept to life from start to finish, whether through dynamic interfaces or robust data systems.

## The Challenges and Growth

The bootcamp was intense, as expected, but also incredibly rewarding. One of the biggest challenges was learning to collaborate on projects using Git and GitHub. Version control and teamwork are essential in software development, and adapting to this new workflow was a steep learning curve. Additionally, developing algorithms—a skill I continue to practice daily—pushed me to think in new ways and solidify my problem-solving abilities.

## Looking Ahead

Graduating from the bootcamp was just the beginning. My next steps involve:

Practicing and Studying: Coding is a continuous learning process, and I’m committed to sharpening my skills every day.

Building Projects: I’m actively working on new projects to expand my portfolio and demonstrate my capabilities to potential employers.

Landing My First Role: I’m determined to secure an entry-level development position where I can leverage my sales experience, business acumen, and technical skills.

## Reflections on the Journey

This career pivot has been challenging, but it’s also been one of the most fulfilling endeavors of my life. The encouragement from loved ones, the skills I’ve gained, and the resilience I’ve built through recovery have all led me to this point. For anyone considering a similar path, I hope my story serves as a reminder that it’s never too late to pursue a passion or redefine your future.
