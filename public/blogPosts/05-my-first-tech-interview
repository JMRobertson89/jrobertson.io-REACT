# My First Tech Interview: Wins and Lessons

**Published on April 7, 2025**

### Taking the Leap

This past month, I had my very first technical interview for a software engineering role. While I didn’t get the job, the experience gave me a valuable look into what the interview process really feels like—and left me more motivated than ever.

### The Process

The interview was split into two parts:

**Phone Screen – Soft Skills Focus**
The first round was a phone screen centered around communication and teamwork. I felt this part went really well. I was able to talk about my journey into tech, the projects I’ve worked on, and how I collaborate with others. It felt less like a test and more like a conversation—which helped me relax and be myself.

**Technical Interview – Live Coding Session**
For the second round, I was given two hours to solve two coding problems. I completed both, though it took me the entire two hours. That part left me a bit frustrated, as I would’ve liked to finish faster.

One of the problems required parsing a CSV file, something I had never done before. After a quick google search (which was allowed), I found an npm package that could handle it and integrated it into my solution. Even though it was new to me, I figured it out on the fly and got everything working.

### What Went Well

After the interview, I received some thoughtful and encouraging feedback. The interviewer called out a few things that stood out:

- **Clean Logic and Naming:** They appreciated how I structured my code and named variables clearly. This is vital in allowing others to understand your code.

- **Resourcefulness:** They were impressed by how quickly I found and understood the npm package I needed to use. If you are in a similar situation, make sure to have clear direction on whether using resources is ok in your technical interview.

- **Problem-Solving Under Pressure:** Even though I hadn’t solved that specific problem before, I was able to work through it effectively in real time.

### What I Learned

1. **Time Management Matters:** Solving the problems took the full two hours. I need to work on my pacing and get more comfortable identifying solutions faster.

2. **It’s Okay to Look Things Up:** I felt unsure about using resources during interviews, but this experience reminded me that using the right tools effectively is a skill in itself.

3. **I’m On the Right Track:** I may not have landed the role, but this process validated the progress I’ve made and showed me where to grow next.

### What’s Next
I’m back to studying, building, and applying. This interview taught me that every step, whether or not it ends in an offer, is part of the process.

The grind continues, but now it’s with even more focus and clarity.
